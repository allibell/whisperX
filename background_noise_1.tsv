754	1294	Hello, Amy.
1434	2095	I'm Dr. Jones.
2115	2935	How are you doing today?
5197	7798	I'm OK, but it hurts when I go to the bathroom when I pee.
9319	11240	That's called dysuria, and it's pretty common.
11821	12561	When did this start?
13702	14322	Two days ago.
14342	16784	Have you taken anything for it?
17744	20686	I tried to Tylenol and drink cranberry juice and help.
22187	23108	Have you had this before?
24068	27490	Yes, I had this several years ago before you were my doctor.
27510	30252	Do you remember about what year that was?
31201	32642	Um, I think it was 2018.
32682	33062	Okay.
33182	36865	How was it treated back then?
36885	42048	The clinic gave me an antibiotic, um, bacterium, and that made it better.
43029	43309	Great.
44109	45410	Is there any chance that you're pregnant?
46531	48972	I use protection, but there's always a chance, I guess.
48992	51754	And so when was your last menstrual period?
51774	53515	Uh, three weeks ago.
54956	55216	Okay.
55236	57618	I think we should check a pregnancy test just to be sure.
59953	71775	Have you had any vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, back pain, shortness of breath, blood in your urine, constipation, diarrhea, or skin rashes?
72776	75796	Yes, I've had abdominal pain down low.
77176	80037	In any vaginal discharge or drainage or painful intercourse?
80457	82077	No.
82097	84418	Do you have any other problems that you'd like me to address?
85298	85378	No.
86809	91291	Okay, I would like to do a simple physical exam and have you give us a urine sample.
92292	99395	I will order both pregnancy tests and urine tests and that we will do now and determine treatment when we have the results.
99415	100496	Does that sound okay to you?
