00:00:00,754 --> 00:00:01,294
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, Amy.

2
00:00:01,434 --> 00:00:02,095
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Dr. Jones.

3
00:00:02,115 --> 00:00:02,935
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?

4
00:00:05,197 --> 00:00:07,798
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm OK, but it hurts when I go to the bathroom when I pee.

5
00:00:09,319 --> 00:00:11,240
[SPEAKER_01]: That's called dysuria, and it's pretty common.

6
00:00:11,821 --> 00:00:12,561
[SPEAKER_01]: When did this start?

7
00:00:13,702 --> 00:00:14,322
[SPEAKER_00]: Two days ago.

8
00:00:14,342 --> 00:00:16,784
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you taken anything for it?

9
00:00:17,744 --> 00:00:20,686
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to Tylenol and drink cranberry juice and help.

10
00:00:22,187 --> 00:00:23,108
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you had this before?

11
00:00:24,068 --> 00:00:27,490
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I had this several years ago before you were my doctor.

12
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,252
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember about what year that was?

13
00:00:31,201 --> 00:00:32,642
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think it was 2018.

14
00:00:32,682 --> 00:00:33,062
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

15
00:00:33,182 --> 00:00:36,865
[SPEAKER_01]: How was it treated back then?

16
00:00:36,885 --> 00:00:42,048
[SPEAKER_00]: The clinic gave me an antibiotic, um, bacterium, and that made it better.

17
00:00:43,029 --> 00:00:43,309
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

18
00:00:44,109 --> 00:00:45,410
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any chance that you're pregnant?

19
00:00:46,531 --> 00:00:48,972
[SPEAKER_00]: I use protection, but there's always a chance, I guess.

20
00:00:48,992 --> 00:00:51,754
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when was your last menstrual period?

21
00:00:51,774 --> 00:00:53,515
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, three weeks ago.

22
00:00:54,956 --> 00:00:55,216
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

23
00:00:55,236 --> 00:00:57,618
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we should check a pregnancy test just to be sure.

24
00:00:59,953 --> 00:01:11,775
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you had any vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, back pain, shortness of breath, blood in your urine, constipation, diarrhea, or skin rashes?

25
00:01:12,776 --> 00:01:15,796
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I've had abdominal pain down low.

26
00:01:17,176 --> 00:01:20,037
[SPEAKER_01]: In any vaginal discharge or drainage or painful intercourse?

27
00:01:20,457 --> 00:01:22,077
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

28
00:01:22,097 --> 00:01:24,418
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any other problems that you'd like me to address?

29
00:01:25,298 --> 00:01:25,378
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

30
00:01:26,809 --> 00:01:31,291
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I would like to do a simple physical exam and have you give us a urine sample.

31
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:39,395
[SPEAKER_01]: I will order both pregnancy tests and urine tests and that we will do now and determine treatment when we have the results.

32
00:01:39,415 --> 00:01:40,496
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that sound okay to you?
