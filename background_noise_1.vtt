00:00.754 --> 00:01.294
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, Amy.

00:01.434 --> 00:02.095
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Dr. Jones.

00:02.115 --> 00:02.935
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?

00:05.197 --> 00:07.798
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm OK, but it hurts when I go to the bathroom when I pee.

00:09.319 --> 00:11.240
[SPEAKER_01]: That's called dysuria, and it's pretty common.

00:11.821 --> 00:12.561
[SPEAKER_01]: When did this start?

00:13.702 --> 00:14.322
[SPEAKER_00]: Two days ago.

00:14.342 --> 00:16.784
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you taken anything for it?

00:17.744 --> 00:20.686
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to Tylenol and drink cranberry juice and help.

00:22.187 --> 00:23.108
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you had this before?

00:24.068 --> 00:27.490
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I had this several years ago before you were my doctor.

00:27.510 --> 00:30.252
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember about what year that was?

00:31.201 --> 00:32.642
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think it was 2018.

00:32.682 --> 00:33.062
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

00:33.182 --> 00:36.865
[SPEAKER_01]: How was it treated back then?

00:36.885 --> 00:42.048
[SPEAKER_00]: The clinic gave me an antibiotic, um, bacterium, and that made it better.

00:43.029 --> 00:43.309
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

00:44.109 --> 00:45.410
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any chance that you're pregnant?

00:46.531 --> 00:48.972
[SPEAKER_00]: I use protection, but there's always a chance, I guess.

00:48.992 --> 00:51.754
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when was your last menstrual period?

00:51.774 --> 00:53.515
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, three weeks ago.

00:54.956 --> 00:55.216
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

00:55.236 --> 00:57.618
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we should check a pregnancy test just to be sure.

00:59.953 --> 01:11.775
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you had any vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, back pain, shortness of breath, blood in your urine, constipation, diarrhea, or skin rashes?

01:12.776 --> 01:15.796
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I've had abdominal pain down low.

01:17.176 --> 01:20.037
[SPEAKER_01]: In any vaginal discharge or drainage or painful intercourse?

01:20.457 --> 01:22.077
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

01:22.097 --> 01:24.418
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any other problems that you'd like me to address?

01:25.298 --> 01:25.378
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

01:26.809 --> 01:31.291
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I would like to do a simple physical exam and have you give us a urine sample.

01:32.292 --> 01:39.395
[SPEAKER_01]: I will order both pregnancy tests and urine tests and that we will do now and determine treatment when we have the results.

01:39.415 --> 01:40.496
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that sound okay to you?
